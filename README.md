This project was created in January 2024 for the period of 1 working day. I had just started GameDev tv's "C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming For Beginners" course on Udemy. My goal was to advance my C++ skills and dive into a whole new area, which was Game Developement. I liked the course very much and this basic game was the beginning of a series of fun and enriching projects that I made afterwards. 

## Specifics of the game:

- Open the .exe file in the main directory to play the game
- The project was developed using the Raylib library and Visual Studio Code
- **Goal of the game:** move the blue ball around from one side to the other, using the control keys below, and don't let the pink "axe" touch your ball, otherwise you lose; also, you can't win, you can only lose ðŸ˜‚

Game control keyboard keys: (classical ones were chosen)

```sh
w -> UP
s -> DOWN
a -> LEFT
d -> RIGHT
```
